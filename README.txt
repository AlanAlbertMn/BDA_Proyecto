To replicate the project first you must open both .sql files and paste the scripts respectively into the MySQL an Postgres systems.
The script for MySQL is called "MySQL_DB_Commands.sql"
The script for Postgres is called "Postgres_DB_Commands.sql"

Once you have both databases, then you may execute the command "git clone https://github.com/AlanAlbertMn/BDA_Proyecto/tree/master"
into the folder "htdocs" found inside folder "xampp".

To insert entities into the system you may click the respective buttons which have the key word "Agregar"

Note: some brands, categories and providers are already set up but the database owner may add others, update or remove them.
